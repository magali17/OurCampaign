# Overview 

**Purpose**: This script documents the quality control procedures taken to ensure data quality after the ACT TRAP mobile monitoring campaign.

                               paste0("PMPTSCREEN_", c(1,4))
)
```

### --> add lab duplicate collocation data    

## helper tables

```{r}
#imports, fieldnotes, and location tables
load(file.path("Data", "Original", "imports_fieldnotes_location_tables.rda"))

calibrations <- readRDS(file.path("Data", "Original", "lab_calibrations_in_fixed_rooms.rda")) %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(substr(time, 1, 10))) %>%
  filter(
    #not sure why tim measured these  
    !analyte %in% c("no, nox"),
    # only keep instrument readings we're interested in
    variable %in% ap,
    #drop instruments w/ few readings (only want a primary and backup instrument)
    !instrument_id %in% drop_instruments
  ) %>%
  
  #drop analyte since this is sometimes wrong (Amanda); other variables make duplicate rows - due to merging issue earlier?
  select(-c(analyte, id, import_id, level)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na(instrument_id, variable, value)

```

## stop data

```{r}
#all stop data
dt0 <- readRDS(file.path("Data", "Original", "stop_data_2019-02-22_2020-03-17.rda")) %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(substr(time, 1, 10))) %>%
  filter(
    # only keep instrument readings we're interested in
    variable %in% ap,
    #drop instruments w/ few readings (only want a primary and backup instrument)
    !instrument_id %in% drop_instruments,
    #drop Roosevelt Garage
    #location != "MS0000"
  ) %>%
  #drop empty data
  drop_na(value) %>%
  # drop ~ 700 duplicate rows - why are these here?? MS000?
  distinct()
  

#ID primary instruments
primary_instruments <- dt0 %>%
  group_by(variable, instrument_id) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n()
  ) %>% 
  group_by(variable) %>%
  filter(n == max(n)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pull(instrument_id)
 
dt0 <- dt0 %>%
  mutate(primary_instrument = ifelse(instrument_id %in% primary_instruments, "Primary", "Backup" ),
         primary_instrument = factor(primary_instrument, levels = c("Primary", "Backup"))
         )


# DUPLICATE ROWS??
# There ~ 15k rows w/ duplicate information other than the value column. Looks like co_14 (the primary CO2 instrument) was primarily responsible for this - it reported duplicate readings at any given time. Duplicate readings appear to be very similar. Was this related to an instrument logging issues?? We'll average over these.

## DOE 

```{r, eval=F}
# #tell R time is actually 8 hrs behind GMT (always in PST), then convert to include PDT. Otherwise, R thinks the times are all in PDT & PST. DO THIS FIRST - before calculating other temporal variables.

daylight_start <- ymd("2019-03-10")
daylight_end <- ymd("2019-11-03")

#LA time
summer <- ymd_hm("2019-03-11 15:00", tz = mytz)
fall <-ymd_hm("2019-11-04 15:00", tz = mytz)

# reset time to actually be in PST, then adjust to LA time
with_tz(ymd_hms(summer, tz = "Etc/GMT+8"),

        )

with_tz(ymd_hms(fall, tz = "Etc/GMT+8"),
        tzone = mytz
        )

```

* **note** DOE data is fixed so that it is read as PST (correct) and then converted to LA time (includes daylight savings) like the rest of our mobile monitoring data. If Dave S fixes this in the dataset, this initial setting should be removed/adjusted.

* note, hourly and daily readings should be "validated" by the DOE since the final files were requested > 3 months after the data were collected (how long it takes DOE to validate data.)

```{r}

  # make code run faster
  group_by(location_doe, freq, variable, pollutant) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%

  facet_grid(pollutant~freq, scales="free", space = "free_y") + 
  geom_bin2d(aes(fill=count)) + 
  
  labs(title =  "Available regulatory data")

```

* check that minute and hour data are similar since only hourly data are validated by DOE

```{r}
#compare minute and hour data

  select(-import_id) %>%
  filter(freq %in% c("minute", "hour")) %>%
  #remove minute time stamp from minute data

  ) %>%
  kable(caption = "differnece between minute and hourly readings (minute-hour value)") %>%

```

* there is a lot more variability in the minute data compared to the hourly data. This could be real, or it could be noise.    
* [not shown in plot] smooth line is directly over the 1-1 line, indicating that minute data are in agreement with hourly data

observations    
* 10W and BH had PM2.5 from different sources over the course of the year 

```{r}
#check that there is sufficient data in the minute data 
doe %>%
  filter(freq == "minute") %>%
  distinct(location_doe, variable, pollutant, date) %>%
  
  filter(!variable %in% drop_doe_vars) %>%

  facet_grid(pollutant~location_doe, scales="free", space = "free_y") + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.1) + 
  
  labs(title = "Available minute data during the study period")

  
```

* note, most are FEM methods (not nephs; also, not all bam methods are FEM - e.g., doe_bam_pm25?)    
* there is some overlap in instrument readings. This is probably done on purpose by the PSCAA in order to calibrate readings from different instruments. We will drop instrument reading as soon as another FEM method starts sampling.    
* BC readings at 10W are missing for ~4 months from around May-Aug 2019

# Instrumentation

Instrument notes

* extreme instrument readings outside the range. Individual spikes may indicate poor instrument performance, but sustained spikes may be true though they may have reduced accuracy. Taking median stop concentrations and dropping median concentrations outside the range of the instrument readings should address these ideas?

  - from Tim G: "Not only the magnitude of the reading matters, but also the duration of the extreme value readings.  Instrument readings that are outside the manufacturers' rated range are best omitted from the data set, especially if they are one-time spikes.   A sustained extreme reading suggests that a high level of the pollutant has been detected but the quantity may not be very reliable.  You might consider replacing the numeric levels that exceed the manufacturers' rated maximum with that maximum number for sustained exceedances, on the premise that the device isn't made to measure higher than the stated level."

* The legacy NO2 CAPS monitor used at the start of the study does not have automatic baseline adjustment so would be reset on a weekly basis instead of occurring a few times during the monitoring day as with the newer fast-response unit.

* There were no clock issues with either NanoScan.  The clock issues were primarily with the P-Traks, but the resetting of internal clock before every drive kept the clock drift to a minimum.  After ~6 hrs, the clock for the instrument might be off by 2 to 3 sec. 

```{r}
instrument_range <- dt0 %>%
  distinct(variable) %>%
  mutate(
    Min = c(0, 0, 0, 10^3, 0, 10^2, 0, 0),

# Quality Assurance 

## Calibrations

* I think the "level" column is what the instrument read, while the conc column is the true concentration during a calibration procedure. 
* pm25 is nephelometer readings 

* **NOTE**: don't use the "analyte" column, which is wrong for some instruments (Amanda confirmed this). Use instrument_id column.

```{r}
# NOTE: don't use "analyte" column, which is wrong for some instruments??

calibrations %>%
  #one record per calibration attempt
  distinct(date, instrument_id) %>%  
  #number of times each instrument was calibrated

  ) %>%
  kable(caption = "Number of gas instrument calibrations (incluing nephelometers [PM25]) and particle instrument zero checks during the study period") %>%
  kable_styling()

## Zeroing for particle intruments
notes   
* notes field does not clarify exact time when the particle filter was placed/removed from the instruments. You can typically see instrument readigns dip for a period of time before going back up though (e.g., 2019-10-22).

amount of data outside of expectd instrument ranges
   
* out of range date is more likely to be below the minimum instrument range. Removing all values outside the instrument range could thus bias overall median slightly up (this was more true when we ran this at the raw second level, where ~16% of BC data was below the min)

  left_join(dt)

```


# Time series of when the lowest and highest values were observed

* as an example, we're just looking at the lowest and highest readings here

* pulling out the second data used to calculate site medians to better inspect the instrument patterns for possible errors

    #simplify plots
    variable = ifelse(variable %in% c("ns_total_conc", "pmdisc_number", "pnc_noscreen", "pnc_screen"), "UFP", variable)
    )

```

**highest (max) readings**

* high instrument observations tend to occur when other particle readings are also high, particularly for particle instruments

* CO2_19 (backup) has much higher readings than co2_14 (primary) on 6/13 and higher readings than other CO2 readings.     
  * **drop all co2_19 readings?** co2_19 also recorded the highest co2 readings in the dataset on the same day at different stops. CO2_19 was never used on its own.

* BC on 2/10 stands out here, but other particle instruments are also increasing though less so
* **keep NO2_2 on 5/11 since otehr instruments are also high?**

# Update Datasets

**Stop level data**

* dropped stop medians outside each instrument's reporting range b/c these readings are less trustworthy/accurate (kept readings at the second level since we will mainly be dealing w/ stop medians)

* Dropped all co2_19 readings b/c    
  * this instrument tends to report high values
  * its values were higher than CO2_14 when they were collocated
  * it was a backup instrument that was never used on its own

* dropped SCAN 3 after 2019 when collocation readings looked different than SCAN 5
  * we collected a few extra days of data with this instrument at the begining of the campiagn   
  * SCAN 3 (Edmund's) was an older instrument    

* if duplicate instruments were on the platform, calculate their median value

# AQS sites 

Looking at the ACT TRAP field protocol, it looks like BC, NO2 and neph (also neph PM2.5) values are collected every minute, though these are not officially validated like the hourly data are. We will use these instead of hourly data since we want to compare these readings to our 2-minute collocations.

Note that BH and 10W don’t have minute data. BH has rolling 1-hour averages every 6 minutes for PM2.5 (teoms), while 10W seems to report the same thing every minute for about an hour (~58 min). 

We will have to use a mix of semi-hourly PM2.5 data and hourly data for BH and 10W since data comes from various non-minute-level sources.


-see if our campaign measurements were similar to those from AQS sites. Compare AQS:
  - 2-min medians
  - 2-min annual avg estimate
  - true annual avg w/ full data

## Calibrate neph readings

* e.g., PM2.5 will be used for Kaya's disparities paper 

- if our neph readings are similar to the readings from AQS sites (near 1-1 line), we'll use Cooper's calibration curve to estimate PM2.5 mass concentration from bscat. Alternatively, we can create a new calibration based on the PM2.5 readings at the AQS sites we visited during our campaign (?).

* see what how the DOE calibrates nephelometer readings to estimate PM2.5. Note that they do this at the site level.

```{r}
# #doe2 #could use this, but have to filter specific sites that used npm25 for PM2.5 estimates
# #
# doe %>%
#   select(-c(import_id, pollutant)) %>%
#   filter(variable %in% c("doe_neph", "doe_npm25"),
#          freq=="minute"
#          ) %>% 
#   spread(variable, value) %>% 
#   
#   colo.plot(x.variable = "doe_neph", y.variable = "doe_npm25", col.by="location_doe")

```

### --> OK to use doe_npm25 as dependent variable in this model (vs. hourly PM2.5 - what DOE uses in their models)? SHouldn't make a big difference? 

```{r}
#lm fit
doe_lm <- doe %>%
  select(-c(import_id, pollutant)) %>%
  filter(variable %in% c("doe_neph", "doe_npm25"),
         freq=="minute"
         ) %>% 
  spread(variable, value) %>%
  
  lm(doe_npm25~doe_neph, data=.) 

doe_lm %>% summary()

doe_int <- tidy(doe_lm)$estimate[tidy(doe_lm)$term=="(Intercept)"]
doe_slope <- tidy(doe_lm)$estimate[tidy(doe_lm)$term=="doe_neph"]
   
```


### --> use doe calibration curve instead of ours since this is at the minute level? otherwise need to update calibration curve when Dave updates this.

* using doe neph-pm2.5 calibration at three AQS sites since    
  * these are at the minute level
  * there are a lot of pairs?

```{r}
#convert bscat ___/m to PM2.5 ug/m3 

#estimates from Cooper's work. this will be updated based on what Dave Slager finds.
# int <- 1.060539
# slope <- 2.509793 #*10

# estimates from DOE data (see above)  
int <- doe_int
slope <- doe_slope

```

```{r}
dt_doe <- dt_doe %>%
  #estimate PM2.5 from neph readings
  mutate(PM2.5 = Neph*slope + int)

```


## 2-min collocations (medians)

* There are various discrepancies between DOE and mobile monitoring observations    
  * locations - these are not exaclty the same. Also, the MM vehicle does not always park in the exact same location    
  * instrument differences    
    * all of our PM2.5 estimates come from neph estimates. DOE PM2.5 estimates compared here are both from nephelometer and other measurement methods.     
    * DOE uses site-specific neph-PM2.5 calibration curves. We will use a region calibraiton curve based on multiple AQS sites in the Spatiotemporal modeling region     
      * our MM calibration curve from the ST model excludes Duwamish, even though we use it to predict PM2.5 at Duwamish in this analysis   
    * DOE PM2.5 "minute" readings are actually for longer time periods. For example, rolling 1-hr estimates that are updated every 6 min.
    * the "2-min" median estimates have slightly different start and end times for the MM and DOE estimates. DOE estimates area alwyays exactly 2-min, starting at 00 seconds. MM median stops could have started after 00 seconds into the minute and could have been sligthly longer than 2 min (e.g., 3 min).


###--> use same legends for facets 

```{r, fig.height=10}

## Annual Avg comparisons

```{r}
#calculate annual averages
true_annual <- doe2 %>%
  group_by(location_doe, location, pollutant) %>%
  summarize(
    true_avg = mean(value)
  )

short_term_annual <- dt_doe %>%
  #make long format
  gather("pollutant", "value", matches(c("bc", "neph", "no2", "PM2.5"))) %>%   
  mutate(
    source = ifelse(grepl("doe", pollutant), "DOE", "Mobile Monitoring"),
    pollutant = gsub("doe_", "", pollutant)
  )  %>%
  #dorp places w/o data
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(location, location_doe, pollutant, source) %>%
  summarize(
    value = mean(value)
  )

#note that DOE PM2.5 has no MM equivalent (yet)
true_annual <- left_join(true_annual, short_term_annual) %>%
  drop_na(value) %>%
  ungroup()

```

* annual average neph estimates are not great    
  * though we only had 3 sites with neph readings, and the range was narrow (?)       
* neph-based PM2.5    
  * looks OK except for duwamish for MM campaign    
  * looks better for DOE since they fit site-specific calibration curves   

```{r, fig.height=10}
p <- list()

u_pollutant <- unique(true_annual$pollutant)

for (i in seq_along(u_pollutant)) {
  #i=1
  df <- true_annual %>%
    filter(pollutant == u_pollutant[i])
    
  range <-  df %>%
    summarize(
      min = min(c(true_avg, value)),
      max = max(c(true_avg, value))

  summarize(
    R2_reg = cor(true_avg, value)^2,
    R2_mse = r2_mse_based(true_avg, value),
    RMSE = rmse(true_avg, value)

        digits = 2
        ) %>%
  kable_styling()
  
  
```


Do the observed annual avearge neph readings have a narrow range?

* the distribution of minute-level neph data is much wider than the range of neph estimates we see for the annual averages above. This suggests that the "poor" performing neph readings are all close in range to one another and hence why the plot may be making these look bad even though they are not that different. 
  * neph estimates for these sites (Duwamish, Kent, Tukwilla) are also on the high end relative to 

```{r}
doe2 %>% 
  filter(pollutant == "Neph",
         #sites where we're using neph-based PM2.5 (vs e.g., FEM method)
         #location_doe %in% c("AQSD", "AQSK", "AQSTUK")
         ) %>%
  summarize(
    min = min(value),
    Q05 = quantile(value, 0.05),
    Q25 = quantile(value, 0.25),
    Q50 = median(value),
    Q75 = quantile(value, 0.75),
    #IQR = IQR(value),
    Q95 = quantile(value, 0.95),
    max= max(value)
  )
   
```



When did we visit neph DOE sites? Checking that we conducted balanced sampling at these collocation sites.

```{r}
neph_colos <- dt_doe %>%
  #sites with neph data
  filter(location_doe %in% c("AQSD", "AQSK", "AQSTUK")) %>%
  
  select(location_doe, date, time, Neph) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(
    hour = factor(hour(time)),
    day = wday(time, label = T, week_start = 1),
  ) %>% 
  add_season(.date_var = "date") 

```

* things look OK?  
  * visits by season-day of week look okay. visits didn't occur on every combination, but weekday and weekend samples occurred    
  * there are more gaps in season-hour combinations, though these are also intermittent for the most part   

```{r}
#hour
neph_colos %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hour, y=location_doe)) + 
  geom_bin2d() +
  facet_wrap(~season) + 
  #geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "dodge") 
  labs(title = "number of visits to DOE collocation sites with nephs")

#day
neph_colos %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=day, y=location_doe)) + #fill = location_doe
  geom_bin2d() +
  facet_wrap(~season) +
  #geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "dodge")
  labs(title = "number of visits to DOE collocation sites with nephs")

# #season
# neph_colos %>%
#   ggplot(aes(x=season, y=location_doe)) + #fill = location_doe
#     geom_bin2d()


```



# Appendix

## Calibrate to the mean of instrument readings

* we will not do this since there was generally good agreement between instruments and some backup instruments were less trustworthy (e.g., NO2_1, PMSCAN_3, PMDISC_8 was dropped at one point before being replaced).

### --> update point below if have room collocation for all PTRAKS screened

* note that the screened PTRAKS were not all collocated, though we know that 93 and 94 were similar when they were unscreened, and that 94 and 3 were similar, thus we will assume that at least 3/4 of the instruments were in good agrement. We don't have any collocation information for PTRAK 2, which collected a substantial amount of data.
